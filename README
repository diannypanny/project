This is my final project!

To Do List!
**GitHub Steps**
1. Always do these 4 steps when adding info to files because you need to save them to GitHub
2. Type in the terminal- cd to project
3. git add README (write the file name after add)
4. git commit -m "write in here what changes you made"
5. git push 
6. git status (type this anytime you need to see where you are at in git)


1. Draft out User Flow
2. Pseudocode
3. Research the parts you don't know
4. Set Goals
5. Write Code!

List add view check off
Write it to a file
Read it from file

1. Create a to do list class, the class will have an 
	add method
	remove method
	print method
2. Inside of a while loop:
	print out the options the user has
	prompt the user and save their input
	check to see if the input is safe/correct
	call the corresponding method on the class
